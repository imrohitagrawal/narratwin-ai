# Issue 276 C3A-R1 Review Evidence

Issue: `#276`
Branch: `phase-1-closure-c3a-r1-major-market-multilingual-output-correctness`
Scope: local/mock Checkpoint 3A multilingual output correctness repair.

## Fan-Out Review Status

The earlier final `PASS` evidence for this PR is superseded. Human manual review
after that pass found user-visible semantic failures that the prior
output-correctness fan-out did not catch: Hindi recruiter output could become
engineer output, transliterated or untranslated source terms could survive in the
target text, only one generated line could be translated from a multi-paragraph
approved source, and tests were too willing to trust fixture self-consistency.

The PR is not ready for human approval until the corrected product behavior,
fresh executable gates, manual smoke evidence, and a fresh fan-out review are
recorded below.

The requested sub-agent fan-out had also previously hit usage limits. Obsolete
or completed sessions must be stopped before restarting the required reviewers.

| Requested reviewer | Result | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Output-Correctness Reviewer | `BLOCK` on Atlas source receiving NarraTwin target text; later `BLOCK` on Spanish NarraTwin fixture containing untranslated `project knowledge`. | Fixed source-specific Atlas fixtures, complete Spanish fixture text, and added regression assertions. |
| TDD Reviewer | `BLOCK` because original RED evidence failed at import/collection and follow-up behavior tests were uncommitted. | Added behavior-level tests that fail on the prior implementation and recorded this explicitly; final commit carries the follow-up tests. |
| Doubt-Driven Reviewer | `BLOCK` on provider script/transcript divergence, arbitrary NarraTwin pseudo-translation, weak browser artifact comparison, and UI hardcoded catalog fallback. | Added provider/transcript parity validation, arbitrary-fixture refusal, stronger browser artifact parity, and removed frontend catalog fallback. |
| False-Positive Reviewer | `BLOCK` on missing metadata-only/artifact-only response mutations; rerun returned `PASS`. | Added response-level false-pass mutations and required coverage rows. |

Superseding human-review blockers found after the prior final pass:

| Blocker | Corrective evidence required |
|---|---|
| Wrong selected audience in target text, including recruiter translated as engineer. | Exact semantic golden tests for supported controlled scripts and audience-prefix drift tests. |
| Transliteration or untranslated source terms passing because script presence was treated as enough. | Forbidden source-phrase checks and exact target golden strings for every Priority 1 language. |
| One generated source line translated while the approved source supported multiple cited segments. | Stage 4 generated-script coverage tests, heading-only chunk rejection, and Stage 6 multi-segment transcript/artifact assertions. |
| Fixture self-consistency mistaken for independent output correctness. | Test-owned golden strings that fail when implementation fixtures regress to previous bad output. |
| Downloadable `translatedScript` artifact contained only target text while metadata/UI contained the full transcript. | Runtime script artifact rendering and tests must require source English, target text, English reference, citations, context refs, claim-support ids, source run id, and evaluation id for every segment. |
| Hindi accepted transliterated English terms such as `जनरेट` and `वॉकथ्रू` in a completed transcript. | Hindi golden output and transcript validation must reject transliterated source-domain terms and require fully translated Hindi wording. |

Fresh final review status: `HINDI-TRANSLITERATION FIX LOCAL / GATES AND FULL PR-HEAD FAN-OUT PENDING`.

The final review restarted after pushed head `100c6059795e3d50e2c95f15ef6d203413de5bd6`
was blocked for CP8 default-path nondeterminism. Commit
`609961232e93c0a4efec32704b967dcc2112cb80` fixed that blocker by removing only
dead Next dev locks before the CP8 browser probe starts. A later final
Doubt-Driven sub-agent review on `d87a66e3e43a61ae3f404d3733f9de64c26cb7bc`
found that Russian and Ukrainian successful outputs could still contain the raw
English source-domain term `walkthrough`. Commit
`e8811841d2aa8786d78f4222bbd22b63aeb3d89b` fixes that blocker. In a later
main-session rerun, the sub-agent tool was not exposed, so the same
Doubt-Driven prompt was executed as an independent fallback review against
`e8811841`; it passed with the executable evidence recorded below. Full
current-head sub-agent fan-out then found that the downloadable
`translatedScript` markdown artifact was target-only instead of the same
trilingual transcript data exposed in the UI and metadata. That blocker is
being fixed locally and must be rerun through gates and final fan-out after the
next pushed PR head. Local gates for this fix now pass: `make quality`,
`make checkpoint3-acceptance`, `make ci`, focused Stage 6/API/output-correctness
tests, and the targeted CP8 browser smoke test. A later Output-Correctness
review on `aa9ba02` confirmed the artifact blocker was fixed but found Hindi
still accepted transliterated source-domain terms `जनरेट` and `वॉकथ्रू` in the
fourth transcript segment. That blocker is fixed locally by replacing the Hindi
fixture with fully translated wording and adding Hindi transliteration rejection
to transcript correctness validation; gates and final fan-out must rerun after
the next pushed PR head.

| Final reviewer | Latest result | Evidence summary |
|---|---|---|
| Output-Correctness Reviewer | `BLOCK` before latest fixes | Found the coverage matrix had `0` explicit positive rows and the original NarraTwin manual-review document still refused multilingual generation for representative Priority 1 languages. Fixed by adding one positive matrix row per Priority 1 language, original manual-review document fixture coverage for all Priority 1 local/demo translations, a runtime Hindi API regression for that exact document, native Hindi engineering terminology, and Stage 4 small-document expansion to all approved claim chunks within retrieval top-k. |
| TDD Reviewer | `BLOCK` before latest commit | Runtime tests were green, but reviewer correctly blocked PR-level signoff because the branch had uncommitted changes and evidence docs still said final review was pending. Final TDD signoff must be rerun after commit/push. |
| Doubt-Driven Reviewer | `BLOCK` before latest fixes | Found Playwright CP8 recorded `providers.voice` but did not assert it. Fixed by requiring `voice === "mock"` inside `assertBrowserEvidenceContract()` and adding a Playwright self-mutation that non-mock voice evidence throws. |
| False-Positive Reviewer | `PASS` with additive coverage | Added explicit per-field CP8 provider-posture spoofing tests for LLM, translation, voice, avatar, renderer, network egress, real video, and cloned identity; reran output-correctness, Stage 6 unit, checkpoint acceptance, and targeted Ruff successfully. |
| False-Positive Reviewer, rerun on `c276546` | `PASS` | Confirmed 400-row matrix with 25 `missing-target` rows and no remaining false-positive path in that scope. |
| Doubt-Driven Reviewer, rerun on `c276546` | `BLOCK` before latest local fix | Found `make checkpoint3-acceptance` could fail on the default CP8 browser path when stale local review servers occupied fixed ports `8120`/`3120`, even though the representative browser test passed on alternate ports. Fixed locally by assigning isolated loopback CP8 ports in the acceptance runner and adding a regression test. |
| Doubt-Driven independent fallback, rerun on `100c605` then `6099612` | `PASS` after fix | Reproduced the `100c605` default CP8 blocker, added stale Next dev lock cleanup with live-lock preservation tests, pushed `6099612`, and reran `make checkpoint3-acceptance` successfully at the pushed head. |
| Output-Correctness independent fallback, rerun on `6099612` | `PASS` | Reran exhaustive Priority 1 output-correctness acceptance, Stage 6 unit/API multilingual tests, browser probe, and matrix inspection. Verified 25 Priority 1 positive rows and 25 rows for every false-positive mutation including `missing-target`. |
| TDD independent fallback, rerun on `6099612` | `PASS` | Verified the CP8 failure has regression tests for stale dead-PID Next locks and live-lock preservation, and the existing behavior tests remain green for API/output correctness, artifact parity, browser contract, and provider posture spoofing. |
| False-Positive independent fallback, rerun on `6099612` | `PASS` | Reran output-correctness and acceptance-gate tests after the CP8 harness change. No metadata-only, artifact-only, fallback, partial, wrong-script, missing-source/reference/target/binding, citation-drift, glossary leakage, or provider-posture false-pass path was found. |
| Doubt-Driven Reviewer, rerun on `d87a66e` | `BLOCK` before latest local fix | Found Russian and Ukrainian deterministic fixture outputs leaked standalone English `walkthrough` inside otherwise Cyrillic successful target text. Fixed locally by replacing those target strings, removing the same source term from German, Dutch, and Filipino fixture strings, adding standalone `walkthrough` to forbidden source-term checks, extending the original manual-review document test, and adding runtime validation that rejects untranslated source-domain terms. |
| Doubt-Driven independent fallback, rerun on `e8811841` | `PASS` | Sub-agent tool was not exposed in the main session, so the final Doubt-Driven prompt was executed as fallback. Reran `make checkpoint3-acceptance`, focused Stage 6/API/output-correctness/language-quality/acceptance-gate tests, `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD`, matrix/summary inspection, CP8 port cleanup check, and a direct FastAPI runtime probe for the original NarraTwin manual-review document across Hindi, Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Ukrainian, French, and Thai. The probe verified four cited segments, source English, target text, English reference, native script, no standalone `walkthrough` leakage, citations `[1]` through `[4]`, source/eval/context/claim-support binding, artifact parity, mock providers, and Bengali unsupported refusal. No remaining doubt-driven finding was found in this fallback pass. |
| Output-Correctness Reviewer, rerun on `e8811841` | `BLOCK` before latest local fix | Executed FastAPI runtime multilingual generation and decoded artifacts. The API and metadata had four Hindi transcript segments, but `artifacts.translatedScript.contentBase64` decoded to only flat target-language text. It omitted per-segment source English, English reference/back-translation, citation/context/claim-support bindings, source run id, and evaluation id. Fixed locally by rendering the translated-script artifact as a trilingual transcript and hardening API, acceptance, media-artifact, and browser tests to reject target-only script artifacts. |
| False-Positive Reviewer, rerun on `aa9ba02` | `PASS` | Confirmed 400-row coverage matrix, target-only translated-script artifact rejection, and no false-positive path for metadata-only, artifact-only, partial, fallback, wrong-script, missing source/reference/target, citation drift, missing binding, and glossary leakage. |
| Output-Correctness Reviewer, rerun on `aa9ba02` | `BLOCK` before latest local fix | Confirmed full trilingual artifact parity was fixed across all Priority 1 languages, but found Hindi still accepted transliterated English source-domain terms `जनरेट` and `वॉकथ्रू` in the completed output for “Every generated walkthrough claim...”. Fixed locally by updating the Hindi golden fixture to “प्रत्येक उत्पन्न चरण-दर-चरण प्रस्तुति संबंधी दावे...” and adding runtime Hindi transliteration rejection. |

No full mandatory fan-out sign-off is claimed after the latest Hindi
transliteration fix until gates pass and the mandatory Output-Correctness, TDD,
Doubt-Driven, and False-Positive reviews pass against the same pushed PR head
through actual reviewer notifications or explicitly recorded independent
fallback.

## Corrective Evidence Snapshot

Status: `HINDI-TRANSLITERATION FIX LOCAL / GATES AND FULL PR-HEAD-FANOUT-PENDING`

Current corrective tests added after human review:

| Human-found failure | Executable evidence |
|---|---|
| Recruiter translated as engineer or wrong selected audience preserved. | `tests/unit/test_stage6_multilingual.py::test_hindi_local_demo_translation_preserves_selected_product_audience` and exact Priority 1 recruiter golden strings. |
| Transliterated or untranslated source phrases pass as target text. | `tests/unit/test_stage6_multilingual.py::test_priority1_local_demo_golden_translations_preserve_recruiter_meaning` forbidden-source-phrase assertions. |
| Standalone source-domain term `walkthrough` leaks in successful Cyrillic output. | `tests/unit/test_stage6_multilingual.py::test_cyrillic_transcript_validation_rejects_untranslated_walkthrough_term`, the original manual-review document test's forbidden-term assertions, and runtime `validate_target_script` source-domain term rejection. |
| One generated source line translated from a multi-paragraph approved source. | `tests/api/test_stage4_slice_api.py::test_grounded_script_generation_preserves_product_audience_surface` and Stage 6 API multi-segment transcript assertions. |
| Heading text becomes a generated claim and citation. | `tests/unit/test_retrieval_and_grounding.py::test_chunking_preserves_headings_as_metadata_without_heading_only_claim_chunks`. |
| Original NarraTwin manual-review document refused or only translated a subset of generated segments. | `tests/unit/test_stage6_multilingual.py::test_priority1_local_demo_supports_original_narratwin_manual_review_document`, `tests/api/test_stage6_multilingual_api.py::test_multilingual_walkthrough_api_translates_original_manual_review_document`, and Stage 4 small-document expansion within retrieval top-k. |
| Coverage matrix omitted positive rows while summary said API output passed. | `tests/acceptance/test_checkpoint3_output_correctness.py` now writes and asserts `positive` rows for every Priority 1 language; latest matrix has 400 rows including 25 positive rows and 25 `missing-target` false-positive rows. |
| Browser evidence accepted non-mock voice provider posture. | `frontend/tests/checkpoint3-real-browser.spec.ts` asserts `providers.voice === "mock"` and self-mutates `voice: "elevenlabs"` to prove the browser contract rejects it. |
| Default CP8 acceptance gate could fail from stale fixed local ports or dead Next dev locks. | `scripts/quality/check_checkpoint3_acceptance.py` allocates isolated loopback CP8 ports per run and removes only dead Next dev locks, while preserving live locks; `tests/unit/test_checkpoint3_acceptance_gate.py::test_checkpoint3_acceptance_allocates_isolated_cp8_ports`, `test_checkpoint3_acceptance_removes_stale_next_dev_lock`, and `test_checkpoint3_acceptance_keeps_live_next_dev_lock` prove the harness behavior; `make checkpoint3-acceptance` passes on the default path at pushed head `6099612`. |

## Manual Rehearsal

The durable human/demo checklist is
`docs/demo/CHECKPOINT3A_MULTILINGUAL_REHEARSAL_CHECKLIST.md`.
Automated executable evidence remains primary. Human rehearsal should use that
checklist before merge review to spot-check Hindi, Arabic or Egyptian Arabic,
Korean, Japanese or Chinese, Russian or Ukrainian, and German/Spanish/French in
the local demo without making hosted, provider, paid, cloned-identity, real-media,
or production-readiness claims.
